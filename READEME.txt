Java LISP Interpreter

This project was built using JavaSE-1.8, so earlier versions of java may be incompatable.

The executable file, LispInterpreter.jar, is included in the same tarball as this file, along with the java source-code for the interpreter.

To run the LISP Interpreter, on a computer with Java installed, execute the following command on a terminal from within a directory containing LispInterpreter.jar:

java -jar LispInterpreter.jar

In order to exit the program, use the following command:

(quit)

The interpreter will create an output file called 'results.file' in the same directory as the .jar file.
