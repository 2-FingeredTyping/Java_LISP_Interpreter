This was originally an individual project for my Principles of Programming Language class at New Mexico Tech.
For more information on how the Interpreter works, please view "report.pdf", the commenting through out the source code is unfortunately rather sparse and inconsistant
Below are some basic instructions to the run the interpreter for your self.

To run the LISP Interpreter, on a computer with Java installed, execute the following command on a terminal from within a directory containing LispInterpreter.jar:

java -jar LispInterpreter.jar

In order to exit the program, use the following command:

(quit)

The interpreter will create an output file called 'results.file' in the same directory as the .jar file.
